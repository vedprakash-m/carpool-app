# Cleanup Summary

## Files Removed

We've cleaned up redundant and unnecessary files from the codebase to improve maintainability. The following files were removed:

### Test Files
1. `app/tests/test_schedule_generator_fix.py` - Empty placeholder file that was not being used
2. `app/tests/test_schedule_generator.py` - Redundant tests now covered by the more comprehensive `test_schedule_generator_unit.py` and `test_schedule_generator_comprehensive.py`

### Verification Scripts
1. `app/tests/verify_with_mocks.py` - Replaced by the more robust `verify_schedule_generator_visual.py`
2. `app/tests/simple_verify.py` - Redundant with other verification scripts
3. `app/tests/verify_schedule_generator.py` - Redundant with the more sophisticated `verify_schedule_generator_visual.py`

### Backup/Fixed Files
1. `app/services/schedule_generator.py.fixed` - Source file used to update the main implementation, no longer needed

## Test Structure After Cleanup

The testing infrastructure now has a cleaner and more organized structure:

### Unit Tests
- `test_schedule_generator_unit.py` - Focused unit tests for individual components

### Integration Tests
- `test_schedule_generator_comprehensive.py` - Comprehensive tests that cover both unit and integration aspects
- `test_schedule_generation_integration.py` - Tests for the API endpoints

### Visual Verification
- `verify_schedule_generator_visual.py` - Interactive tool for visually verifying the scheduling algorithm

## Running Tests

Tests can be executed using the `run_schedule_tests.ps1` script, which will:
1. Run the unit tests
2. Run the comprehensive tests
3. Run the visual verification tool

## Benefits of Cleanup

1. **Improved Maintainability** - Fewer files to manage and update
2. **Clearer Test Structure** - Well-organized tests with clear purposes
3. **Reduced Confusion** - Eliminated duplicate implementations and backup files
4. **Better Documentation** - Improved documentation of the schedule generator and its testing
5. **Easier Onboarding** - New developers can more easily understand the codebase
