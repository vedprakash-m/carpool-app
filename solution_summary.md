# Azure Function App with FastAPI - Issue and Solution

## Problem
The Azure Function App was showing the default page instead of the expected FastAPI endpoints. The main issues were:

1. Incorrect configuration in `function.json` - It was pointing to `__init__.py` instead of `main.py`
2. Missing route prefix configuration in `host.json` - The HTTP extensions section needed to be added
3. Missing proxies configuration for the root route - No proxies.json file was present

## Solution
The following fixes were implemented:

1. Updated `function.json` to point to the correct script file:
   ```json
   {
     "scriptFile": "../main.py",
     "entryPoint": "main",
     "bindings": [...]
   }
   ```

2. Updated `host.json` to configure proper routing:
   ```json
   {
     "version": "2.0",
     "extensions": {
       "http": {
         "routePrefix": ""
       }
     },
     "extensionBundle": {
       "id": "Microsoft.Azure.Functions.ExtensionBundle",
       "version": "[3.*, 4.0.0)"
     }
   }
   ```

3. Created a `proxies.json` file to handle the root URL:
   ```json
   {
     "$schema": "http://json.schemastore.org/proxies",
     "proxies": {
       "root": {
         "matchCondition": {
           "route": "/"
         },
         "backendUri": "https://%WEBSITE_HOSTNAME%/api"
       }
     }
   }
   ```

4. Created a deployment script (`deploy_fixed_function.ps1`) to package and deploy the application with the fixes.

## Deployment Steps
1. Run the deployment script with the required parameters:
   ```
   .\deploy_fixed_function.ps1 -functionAppName <function-app-name> -resourceGroup <resource-group-name>
   ```

2. Wait for the deployment to complete and the Function App to restart.

3. Access the Function App at `https://<function-app-name>.azurewebsites.net`.

4. The FastAPI endpoints should now be accessible, including:
   - Root endpoint: `/`
   - API endpoints: `/api/v1/users`, `/api/v1/auth/login`, etc.

## Validation
The configuration was validated using both a diagnostic script (`diagnose_function_app.py`) and a simplified validation script (`simple_validate.py`).

The issue was resolved by ensuring proper integration between Azure Functions and FastAPI using the ASGI middleware, correct routing configuration, and proper deployment process.
