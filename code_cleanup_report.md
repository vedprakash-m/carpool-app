# Code Cleanup Report

## Overview
As part of our ongoing maintenance efforts, we've performed a thorough cleanup of the codebase to remove redundant, duplicate, and unnecessary files. This cleanup focused primarily on the testing infrastructure and backup files that were created during the development process.

## Files Removed

### Test Files
- `app/tests/test_schedule_generator_fix.py` (empty placeholder)
- `app/tests/test_schedule_generator.py` (redundant tests)
- `app/tests/verify_with_mocks.py` (superseded by visual verification)
- `app/tests/simple_verify.py` (redundant verification script)
- `app/tests/verify_schedule_generator.py` (redundant verification script)

### Backup Files
- `app/services/schedule_generator.py.fixed` (source for the updated implementation)

## Benefits

1. **Reduced Codebase Size**: Eliminated approximately 800 lines of duplicate or unused code.
2. **Improved Maintainability**: Fewer files to manage, update, and keep in sync.
3. **Clearer Test Structure**: Well-organized tests with clear responsibilities:
   - Unit tests in `test_schedule_generator_unit.py`
   - Comprehensive tests in `test_schedule_generator_comprehensive.py`
   - Visual verification in `verify_schedule_generator_visual.py`
4. **Better Developer Experience**: New developers can more easily understand the testing approach without confusion from multiple similar files.
5. **Reduced Technical Debt**: Removing unused code prevents it from becoming outdated or causing maintenance issues in the future.

## Current Test Structure

### Unit Tests
- `test_schedule_generator_unit.py`: Focused unit tests for individual components of the scheduler

### Integration/Comprehensive Tests
- `test_schedule_generator_comprehensive.py`: End-to-end tests of the scheduling algorithm with different scenarios
- `test_schedule_generation_integration.py`: Tests for the API endpoints

### Visual Verification
- `verify_schedule_generator_visual.py`: Interactive tool for visually verifying the scheduling algorithm

## Testing Improvements
- Fixed issues with the comprehensive tests to better test different scheduling scenarios
- Added support for asynchronous testing with pytest-asyncio
- Created simpler, more focused tests that are easier to maintain
- Updated test dependencies to include all required packages

## Documentation
- Created `cleanup_summary.md` in the tests directory documenting the cleanup
- Updated `schedule_generator_improvements.md` with details of the testing infrastructure
- Added comments explaining key test scenarios
- Updated `install_test_deps.ps1` to ensure all dependencies are properly installed

## Next Steps

1. Continue to monitor the codebase for redundant or unused code
2. Consider implementing similar cleanup in the frontend codebase
3. Add automated linting to identify unused imports and dead code
