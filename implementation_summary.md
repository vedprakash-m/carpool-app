# Feature Implementation Summary

## 1. Password Strength Validation

### Frontend Implementation
- Enhanced the user creation form with password strength validation
- Added validation rules for:
  - Minimum 8 characters
  - At least one uppercase letter
  - At least one lowercase letter
  - At least one number
  - At least one special character
- Added visual password strength indicator in the profile's change password form
- Added clear explanatory text about password requirements

### Backend Implementation
- Created a `validate_password_strength()` function in `auth.py`
- Implemented comprehensive checks for password security
- Updated the user creation endpoint to validate password strength
- Updated the password change endpoint to validate new password strength
- Added detailed error messages for password validation failures

## 2. Schedule Algorithm Verification

- Created detailed analysis of the scheduling algorithm (in `schedule_generator_fixes.md`)
- Identified key issues:
  - Duplicate code between API endpoints and service
  - Inconsistent container naming
  - Limited error handling
  - Basic fairness algorithm that could be enhanced
  - Lack of unit tests
- Confirmed that the core assignment logic is functionally correct, following proper priority:
  1. Filter out unavailable drivers
  2. Prioritize drivers who marked the slot as PREFERRED
  3. Fall back to LESS_PREFERRED drivers if no PREFERRED drivers exist
  4. Use AVAILABLE_NEUTRAL drivers if no explicit preferences exist
  5. Select the driver with the least historical assignments when multiple candidates exist

## 3. Mobile Responsiveness Issues

### Current Issues
- TypeScript errors in the dashboard layout.tsx file
- Missing React module imports
- JSX interface definition issues

### Plan to Fix Mobile Responsiveness
1. Resolve TypeScript configuration issues
   - Ensure proper tsconfig.json settings
   - Fix module resolution issues
2. Correctly configure JSX interfaces
3. Update the mobile menu implementation for better responsiveness
4. Add proper media queries for different screen sizes
5. Implement proper Tailwind CSS responsive classes
6. Test on different device sizes

## Future Work
1. Fix TypeScript errors by correctly setting up the development environment
2. Implement the consolidated scheduling algorithm service
3. Add comprehensive unit tests for the scheduling algorithm
4. Add more visual cues for password strength
5. Create proper user profiles with avatars and preference settings
