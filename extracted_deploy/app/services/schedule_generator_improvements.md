# Schedule Generator Improvements

## Changes Implemented

We've significantly improved the schedule generator implementation to address the issues identified in the assessment. Here are the key improvements:

### 1. Consolidated Code
- Moved all scheduling logic to the `schedule_generator.py` service
- Removed duplicate implementations and ensured consistent algorithm usage

### 2. Standardized Container Names
- Used consistent container names across the application:
  - `weekly_schedule_template_slots` for schedule templates
  - `driver_weekly_preferences` for driver preferences
  - `ride_assignments` for assignments
  - `users` for user information

### 3. Improved Error Handling
- Added comprehensive error handling for database operations
- Added logging for debugging and monitoring
- Improved error messages for better diagnostics

### 4. Enhanced Fairness Algorithm
- Implemented a sophisticated fairness algorithm that considers:
  - Time since last assignment with recency weighting
  - Number of assignments in recent weeks
  - Relative assignment load compared to other drivers
- The weighted count algorithm gives more weight to recent assignments:
  - 1.0 for assignments in the current week
  - 0.75 for assignments from last week
  - 0.5 for assignments from two weeks ago
  - 0.25 for assignments from three weeks ago

### 5. Added Comprehensive Testing
- Created unit tests for all components of the scheduler
- Added integration tests for the end-to-end schedule generation process
- Created a visual verification tool to validate scheduling logic
- Improved test mocking to simulate various scenarios

### 6. Performance Optimization
- Added caching of preferences and historical data
- Improved database query efficiency
- Added better index usage for queries

### 7. Conflict Resolution
- Added explicit conflict resolution for cases where no drivers are available
- Implemented fallback strategies for handling edge cases

## Key Files Updated

1. `app/services/schedule_generator.py` - Primary implementation of the scheduling algorithm
2. `app/api/v1/endpoints/schedule_generation.py` - API endpoints using the service
3. `app/tests/test_schedule_generator_unit.py` - Unit tests for the scheduler
4. `app/tests/test_schedule_generator_comprehensive.py` - Comprehensive tests covering more scenarios
5. `app/tests/verify_schedule_generator_visual.py` - Visual verification tool for scheduling algorithm
6. `backend/run_schedule_tests.ps1` - Script to run all schedule tests

## Algorithm Implementation Details

The scheduling algorithm works in the following order:

1. **Retrieve Inputs**:
   - Get all template slots for the week
   - Get all active drivers
   - Get driver preferences for the week
   - Get historical assignment metrics for fair distribution

2. **Clear Existing Assignments** (if requested):
   - Remove any existing assignments for the target week

3. **Process Each Slot**:
   - For each template slot in the week:
     - Calculate the specific date for the slot
     - Get all active drivers
     - Filter out unavailable drivers
     - Apply preference-based assignment:
       - Prioritize drivers who marked the slot as PREFERRED
       - Fall back to LESS_PREFERRED drivers if no PREFERRED drivers exist
       - Use AVAILABLE_NEUTRAL drivers if no explicit preferences exist
     - When multiple candidates exist with the same preference level, apply fairness:
       - Select the driver with the least weighted historical assignments
       - Consider time since last assignment
     - Create the assignment record
     - Update the driver's metrics for subsequent slot assignments

4. **Return Results**:
   - Return all created assignments

## Testing Verification

The testing infrastructure now verifies:

1. Basic functionality of each component
2. End-to-end schedule generation process
3. Preference-based driver selection
4. Fairness-based driver selection
5. Error handling and edge cases
6. Visualization of the algorithm's results

The visual verification tool provides a clear view of:
- Driver preferences for each slot
- Historical assignment counts
- Generated schedule with assignment methods
- Verification of key expectations (all slots covered, preferences respected, fairness)

## Next Steps

While we've made significant improvements, here are recommended next steps:

1. **Load Testing** - Test with larger datasets to ensure performance at scale
2. **Advanced Conflict Resolution** - Add more sophisticated conflict resolution strategies
3. **Analytics** - Add analytics to track schedule quality and driver satisfaction
4. **Preference History** - Consider historical preferences in assignment decisions
5. **Geospatial Optimization** - Consider driver proximity to optimize assignments
